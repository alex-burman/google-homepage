by creating a replica of the google.com home page.

The fundamental skills required to complete this project included:
-ability to construct a page layout using HTML
-ability to use a variety of elements such as divs, anchors, images, and inputs to construct the layout
-ability to use CSS to style and align varius elements on the page
